  The Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the difference between
  two strings. If |a| == |b|, the distance is 0. It is roughly the number
  of insertions, deletions, and substitutions needed to convert |a| -> |b|.

  This distance is at most the length of the longer string.
  This distance is 0 iff the strings are equal.

  Examples:
    levenshtein_distance("cow", "bow") == 1
    levenshtein_distance("cow", "bowl") == 2
    levenshtein_distance("cow", "blrp") == 4

  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance for more background.
