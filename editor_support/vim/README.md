# Vim Support

This folder contains various tools and configs for supporting STL and Sprockets
in Vim.

## Syntax Highlighting

  1. Copy the `syntax/stl.vim` file to `~/.vim/syntax/stl.vim`
     This file defines how to highlight stl files.

  2. Copy the `ftdetect/stl.vim` file to `~/.vim/ftdetect/stl.vim`
     This file tells vim to highlight *.stl files with the proper style.
